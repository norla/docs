"Infrastructre as code"

Define infrastructure in config files (as opposed to clicking some web gui).

Plugins called "providers" allow terraform to interact with various cloud platforms.

Providers define units of infrastructure as "resources".

User-written "modules" combine resources from several different providers.

Language is declarative and describes only the disered end-state (says nothing about how to get there)
