RDKAFKA

Multi-threaded client library for Kafka designed for use on "modern hardware" (?). 
Attempts to keep memory to a minimal, payload of consumed messages can pass through to 
the application with 0 memory copying if desired.

Can be configured for high throughput or low latency

Two most important config settings are:

* batch.num.messages
* queue.buffering.max.ms
