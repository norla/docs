# Queue mirroring

Exchanges and bindings are located an all nodes in the cluster.
By default queue contents are located on a single node in the cluster.
To overcome this queues can be mirrored accross multiple nodes for better availability.

A mirrored queue has 1 master and 1-n mirrors. Clients talk to the master the master
and changes are propagated to the mirrors. So all nodes have to do all the work, there
is no load balancing taking place.


While a queue is synchronized all other queue ops are blocked.

Two sync modes:

o Manual: (default) new nodes only receive new messages and will become an exact replica over time.
o Automatic: new nodes also reveive all existing messages. Can cause massive blocking.

## Unmirrored queues
Durable: will become unavailable until the node is back online
Transient: will simply disappear.

## Promition
If a master node fails, the oldest synchronized mirror will be elected as new master.

###ha_promote_on_shutdown
What to do if master is shut down in a controlled manner.
* when_synced: Slaves only take over if fully synced. If no slaves are in sync, treat queue as missing. (DEFAULT)
* always: Slaves take over regardless of whether they are in sync or not. (High Availability but can cause msg loss)

###ha_promote_on_failure
What to do if master crashes.
* when_synced: Slaves only take over if fully synced. If no slaves are in sync, treat queue as missing.
               This is not recommended as the queue must be force deleted in case the master node does
               not return.
* always: Slaves take over regardless of whether they are in sync or not. (DEFAULT)

Summa summarum: durable queues should ALWAYS be mirrored.
A durable non-mirrored queue will become unavailable until the nodes comes back online.
