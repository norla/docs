The log

A re-playable persistent record of history.

Historically solves two problems in database:
 1. ordering changes (for restoring stae after crash)
 2. distributing data (for replication to slave nodes)

State machine replication pricnciple:
 - If two identical, deterministic processes in the same state
   get the same input in the same order, they will produce the
   exact same output and end in the same state.
 - The state of a replica can be described simply by the timestamp of the last processed input.

Tables vs logs:
  - Tables describe snapshots of data at rest
  - Logs caputure change.
  - The log can be used to recreate the snapshot.
  - The log can be used to recreate any previous version of the snapshot.

Data integration:
  - Making all data an organisation has available in all its systems
  - Problems: Lots of data is event based, and there are many storage solutions used in an organisation.
  - Solution: Put all data it in a central log for real-time subscription
  - Easy to check if a subsystem (for example a cache) has gotten an update yet:
    just check that it has a timestamp greater than X.
