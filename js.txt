### Formal declarations:

  o Function parameters.

This is basically is the js compiler is interested in.

Function expressions:

  o When the word "function" is not first in the expression.
  o Named are prefered to unnamed:
     o Function can then be accesed from itself for recursion.
     o Function name shows up in stack traces.
