GraphQL
- - - - -

A query languagei for API:s with queries written as an object structure.
A simple declarative way to retrieve data.

All graphql requests are sent to the same endpoint so clients don't have to worry about:
 o Error handling and response codes
 o Building URL:s, choosing the right HTTP method request bodies for REST servers

Typically used to to provide a single interface to a group of services.
 o Grouping together serveral services as one
 o Proxy / Facade to legacy service

Implementing

1. Define types with fields.
2. Define functions for each field on each type.

For example:

```
type Query {
  me: User
}
 
type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
}

function Query_me(request) {
  return request.auth.user;
}
 
function User_name(user) {
  return user.getName();
}
```
